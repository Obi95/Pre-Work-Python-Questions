# # Question 1
# # Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. 
# The first line of the code has been defined as below.

def message(username):
    print(f"hello_{username}",end="!")

username = "USERNAME"
message(username)

# # Question 2
# # Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

 
def first_odds():
    a = [2,3,5,7]

        
# # Question 3
# # Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

#     def max_num_in_list(a_list):
#         .....

# # Question 4
# # Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not
#  divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

#     def is_leap_year(a_year):
#         .....     

# # Question 5
# # Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, 
# [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean
#  Type.

#     def is_consecutive(a_list):
#
